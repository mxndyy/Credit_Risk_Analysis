# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Analysis Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to utilize machine learning models and evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in an effort analyze credit risk and provide Jill with your recommendations. 


## Deliverables:
This assignment consists of 3 technical analysis deliverables and a written report on the Credit Risk Analysis. 

1. ***Deliverable 1:*** Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
2. ***Deliverable 2:*** Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
3. ***Deliverable 3:*** Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
4. ***Deliverable 4:*** Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
